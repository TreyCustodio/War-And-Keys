#  War and Keys
A typing game by YungTreyGames (Trey Custodio)
Art by my classmate and teammate Colin Bridges

You are stranded in the middle of nowhere with nothing but your voice! 
Viscious creatures are rapidly approaching your position, 
and the only thing you can do is yell!
Luckily, the creatures are sensitive to sound,
so type as fast as you can to form words and survive!

##  Controls
1. Keep track of your health in the top-left of the screen
2. Type the words above each enemy to destroy them
3. Gain powerups by completing difficult words in yellow text
4. Survive as long as you can!
